                    <h2><span>Charmaine Axalan</span></h2>
                    <p>First, good day dear readers! My name is Charmaine S. Axalan, currently a 17 years old senior high school student at Talipan National High School. I was born on November 14, 2006 at Memorial Hospital located in Lucena City, Quezon, Philippines. I am the eldest daughter of the family and I only have one younger sister. I am apart from my parents who are working both in Rizal, and since 5 years old I've been with my grandmother growing up along with my sister until my parents took her in the year 2020.

I am mostly interested in art specifically in photography and sketching but not really inclined to it. My dream and goal is not a job but to succeed in every aspect of life in terms of wanting to live a life filled with hopes and passions. I want to go to all of my dream destinations in the world, meet different people and reculture. I believe that at least one kindness can be a bridge to much more to come.

Factor, currently studying in senior high school, eleventh grade, at the National High School of Talipan under the "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Strand."

For me, "student life is golden life, because student life is the most important part of human life. It is a period of pure joy and happiness because the mind of the student is free from the cares and worries of a grown-up life.

                    <h2><span>Rhianne Ramos</span></h2>
                    <p>Greetings! I'm Rhianne F. Ramos. 

                        I was born on April 24, 2007 at Jecson Medical Center in Tarlac. I am also the eldest among the two children of Mr. and Mrs. Ramos. Both of our parents work as OFWs. So, I grew up with my grandparents in Gerona, Tarlac, for 14 years until my mother came home. 
                        
                        I attended junior high school in GJC and graduated from LCNHS-MMCA. Moreover, I am currently an 11th grade STEM student at Talipan National High School. I am a regular student and a member of the math club and stem club. I am also attending a Japanese class online. 
                        
                        My goal is to become a successful person in the future as a civil engineer. I cook and draw occasionally, so I might as well consider being a cook and an architect.

                    <p>My name is Sean Cedric Paradero, 18 years old born on December 29 2005 in Laguna. I am currently living in Pagbilao Quezon Province with my mother and sibling.I am now grade 11 and I like to play musical instruments that's why I have a musical band named After Class Band.We are performing in some events like birthdays, school events and many more. I am happy that I have joined this band because I found a second family that lives happily with music. And I like to stare at beautiful views like sunsets, mountains and more. But sometimes when I'm seeing sunsets, I become sad because I think that this is the end of the journey but after looking at it,I become motivated to continue life..</p>
